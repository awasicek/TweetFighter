# Tweet Fighter 

##### by Andrew Wasicek

## Vision Description

In today's world, Twitter has turned into a platform from which many users broadcast messages that others find seriously offensive.   These offensive Twitter users range from anonymous internet trolls all the way to world leaders.  In order to allow everyday humans to cope with the constant bombardment of uncivil and derogatory tweets, Tweet Fighter must be made.  Tweet Fighter is the application that will allow you, the user, to fight back against these tweets â€” literally.  

Harnessing the power of technologies such as JavaFX and [Twitter's own public API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html), Tweet Fighter allows a player to fight their Twitter enemy (represented by their Twitter profile image) in a battle to the death.  While the Twitter enemy is a formidable opponent, being able to hurl offensive tweets from their recent history at the player, they are not unstoppable.  With skill, the user can fight and destroy these outrageous social media outbursts and ultimately vanquish their Twitter enemy.  

## Requirements

(1) Multiple states: start, game, end.

(2) AJAX calls to Twitter API to fetch tweets and user profile for the chosen opponent

(3) Game engine (e.g., use Timer class and action listener to draw frames)

(4) Gameplay where the user "fights" the oncoming tweets
